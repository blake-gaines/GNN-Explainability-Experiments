Unclear pieces of GNNInterpreter:
How to initialize generated graph?
Regularization on all params or just Omega?
Convergence Criteria?
Unstable training loss?

Ideas:
    Budget penalty penalizes deviation from original graph. Try only visualizing deviations.
    Instead of just maximizing correct logit, also minimize incorrect logits, or maximize correct - incorrect logits. Maybe also consider the distribution of logits for the training set.
 *  Using LP, constrain high output for target class and minimize edit distance.
    Slider to visualize interpolation between original and modified graph.
