Unclear pieces of GNNInterpreter:
How to initialize generated graph?
Regularization on all params or just Omega?
Convergence Criteria?
Unstable training loss?

Ideas:
Budget penalty penalizes deviation from original graph.
Instead of just maximizing correct logit, also minimize incorrect logits, or maximize correct - incorrect logits.
Get differences between explanation graphs with different targets from the same initialization, penalize edit distance.
Using LP, get inputs corresponding to many output probabilities. Consider different logits corresponding to the same probabilities.
Using LP, constrain high output for target class and minimize edit distance.
